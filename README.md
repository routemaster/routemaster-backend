Walking is boring. Let's turn it into an online multiplayer competitive game!

- Map your walking, running, biking, or even driving paths with GPS on your
  phone.
- View past routes, and the routes of your friends
- Earn points for walking efficient routes
- Earn points for exploring more area than your friends

Repository Organization
-----------------------

This is the repository for our back-end. It should store routes, user data, and
other associated information in a MongoDB database, and serve it to the
front-end as needed via a JSON-based API. With a few exceptions, the code in
this repository should be written in Java.

Project Scope
-------------

This project is being created by a team of eight students at the University of
Florida for CEN3031, Introduction to Software Engineering. It will be developed
in three Scrum sprints over the course of the Spring 2013 semester.
